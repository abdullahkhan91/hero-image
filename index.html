    <p>After the passage of the 18th Amendment in 2012 in Pakistan, educational administration became a provincial subject. Since then, there has been a keen interest among various stakeholders to explore education indicators like subject proficiency and percentage of enrollment at the provincial and district level. 
      This website utilizes data from the 2018 Annual State of Education Report (ASER) to provide visualizations that seek to address this interest.</p>
